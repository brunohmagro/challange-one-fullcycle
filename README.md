# Challange One FullCycle (Image GoLang)

- <b>Overview</b>

You will have to post an image to the docker hub. When we run:

docker run <seu-user>/codeeducation

We have to have the following result: Code.education Rocks!

If you notice, this image just prints the message as the final result, so it's worth checking out Go Lang's own website to learn how to make a "hello world".

Remembering that Go Lang has official images ready, it is worth consulting the Docker Hub.

The image of our Go project needs to be less than 2MB =)

Tip: In the intro video about Docker when we talk about the layered file system, I present a "root" image, maybe it's a good one to use.

Have Fun!
